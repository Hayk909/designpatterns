Implementation Requirements
===========================

 1. Every committed version of code ***must pass the compilation!***
 2. Do not commit ***temp files***, and ***build results**.*
 3. Write complete ***commit messages***, describe current changes!
 4. Keep code ***clean, readable*** and ***use same indentation*** for entire project.
 5. Write ***Doxygen comments*** for all the *header files and their components*!
    - Write comments for *hard parts of implementation* as well.
 6. Try to use ***“Top down”*** approach. ***Design, then implement**!*
    - Do a ***step by step implementation***, and commit every step you do! 
    - There can be empty functions, classes committed, with TODO marks.
